//What is an array?
//-> Array is a object used to store values in it.
//Array has multiple methods such as,
// 1. pop() is used to remove last element from array,
// 2. push() is used to add element from the last in array,
// 3. unshift() is used to add element at the start of an array,
// 4. shift() is used to remove starting elements in the array,

// SwitchCase() is for, 
// one input and multiple outcomes, 
// multiple outcomes and one input cases.

// loops can be used with, 
// break statement and continue statement, 
// break statement cut the array at given input and,
// continue statement continues the execution even if required input is achieved.

// map() is used to transform one array in to new array and it is used as arrayname.map(function(el,index,arr)),
// filter() is same as map() function,
// reduce() is used to combine all array in to a single value. It is used as arrayname.reduce(function(accumulator,el,index,arr))
// ForEach() method is used to add an element to each array value.
// flat() is used to add all array in single value.
// slice() is used to remove or extract array from start index to end index(not include).
